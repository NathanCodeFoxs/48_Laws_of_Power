                            Always ensure that those above you feel superior. In your desire to impress or please them, do not go too far in displaying your talents, 
                            lest you accomplish the opposite – inspire fear and insecurity. It's a balancing act where you must show your value without overshadowing 
                            your superiors.

                            Friends can quickly become rivals and betray you, while enemies are more predictable. When converted into a friend, 
                            an enemy has more to prove and might be more loyal. It’s not about being paranoid but rather pragmatic in understanding

                            Anything that comes without a cost should be approached with caution. 
                            It could come with hidden strings or obligations that might compromise 
                            your power and independence in the long run.

                            Attacking a group leader can often disorient the rest of the members. 
                            This tactic, however, should be used sparingly and ethically, as it can lead to 
                            serious consequences if mishandled.

                            Appearing too perfect can arouse envy and suspicion among others. It's essential to show occasional
